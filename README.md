## Introduction
This application was built as a take home challenge and utilizes the NYT [Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps/15541d91-0216-4e06-a8d7-cdca6b617567). Developers were given an 8-hour time frame to meet an MVP, but all other decisions were to be made by them.

The project spec can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe), and the rubric can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_rubric).


## Technologies
  - React
  - React Router
  - GitHub Actions
  - Javascript
  - JSX/HTML
  - CSS
  - Cypress
  - Express/Restful APIs

## Features
- On page load, a user will see a selection of article thumbnails across a variety of categories. From there, they can click on an article for more details, or use the dropdown menu to filter for more specific articles.
- When viewing an article's details, a user can 'Save for Later'. They can then navigate to their Saved Articles to revisit them.

## Possible Future Extensions
- I would love to add user authentication in the future so that a user can save specific articles under their personal profile.
- I would also enjoy building out testing for all sad paths, as just the happy paths are tested at the moment.  

## Set Up
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. `cd` into the directory once cloned.
3. Run `npm start` to view the application in your browser.
4. Enjoy exploring new articles!
